# Machine-Learning Projects 
The purpose of these projects is to use machine learning workflow including K-nearest neighbours (Univariate and Multivariate Models) and Cross Validation to predict a car's market price using its attributes. 

The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. 

For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.
